<i>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Super</i>

  <head>This is a very very early idea of what is meant to be a more comprehensive "select" profile gallery for overclocking, undervolting, and temp/fan control over 1660S cards.</head>

  <strong>As of writing; generally in early to mid 2021, the 1660 Super's in the market could be a bit messy in tuning for a variety of reasons. This is a record and a working list of what's been the case for those disclosed within.</strong>

   <body>I'd like to imagine this would become more than one card and one static repo; for now, it's going to be a divergence of general good practice on popular software for mining (such as the .json formatting/current use of NH's customconfig functionality.) as it becomes easier to see if there's still significant variety unrealized among the varied hardware sold since the 1660 Super's release.</body>
